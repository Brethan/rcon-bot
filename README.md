# Bot that I use to track when my friends are playing Minecraft

it does what it says it does :)

On your local, you will need to create a `.env` file.

```dosini
TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token
GUILD=your-discord-server-id: 10929...120398
CHANNEL_NAME=your-player-tracking-channel
SERVER_NAME=Your Minecraft Server Name
RCON_HOST=your.minecraft.server.ip
RCON_PORT=Your minecraft server RCON port
RCON_PASSWORD=Your minecraft server RCON password
```

Please also include a jpg file to be used for the embed message
that will be used for the player tracker.

It must be called `thumbnail.jpg` otherwise you will need to change the code.
